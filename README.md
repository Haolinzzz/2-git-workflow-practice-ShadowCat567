## My Response
This article is only really tangentally related to software development, but I found it to be fairly interesting, especially since I took an introductory lingustics course last spring. During that course, we spent a section discussing how babies and children learn language, since it seems to be a fundamental ability of human children to be able to develop the ability to understand and speak the language (or languages) spoken in their environment fairly rapidly and effectively enough so speaking the language(s) they were exposed to becomes second nature. This article discusses how a group of researchers is attempting to use babies to help train AI models to be more effective at manipulating language. This article did not really put out any conclusive findings from this experiment as it is still on going, but it is interesting to consider, if we are able to teach AI to learn language like a human,  what could it teach us about the way humans learn language. In general, lingustics has a surprisingly large number of connections to computer science, so there is a lot that could be gained from more overlap betweeen these fields.
